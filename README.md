# Backlog App

This was the final project in the University of Connecticut's Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. The only requirement given to us was that we had to utilize the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). The purpose of this app is to allow users to keep track of media they are currently consuming.

## Features

### Media creation

- The backlog app creates data to be written to the database via the "Create New Media" form. The user inputs the title of the media,
  the type being book/movie/show/game/album. This form also allows a status to be associated with said media. You can mark items as Not Started/In Progress/Finished/Unowned.

### Filter

- The filter options allow for a quick and easy way to display what type of media a user wishes to look at. Filters can also be cleared easily via "Clear Filters"

### Cards

- When a user submits a new media, the data is stored using the MongoDB database. This data is then used to display the data via cards for easy consumption.

## How to use it

### Local

- This application was bootstrapped using "create react app" so you can use command "npm start" from the command line to open it on your preferred browser.

### Web Application

- Currently unavailable

## Important Notes

- This application is currently in queue to be debugged. If you are looking at this project, feel free to look through the code or ask me about the structure and flow of the program. I'm happy to provide my insight on the development of the application.

Thank You!
